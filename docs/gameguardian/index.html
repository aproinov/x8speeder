This document provides guidelines for people who want to contribute to the
documentation-style-guide-sphinx project.


**************
Create tickets
**************

Please use the `game guardian`_ **before** starting some work:

* check if the bug or feature request has already been filed. It may have been
  answered too!
* else create a new ticket.
* if you plan to contribute, tell us, but don't wait for us! So that we are
  given an opportunity to discuss, join forces or give feedback as soon as
  possible.


**************
Test and build
**************

Tests and builds will automatically be triggered before commit:

* tests include the build of documentation and README as HTML.
* a `Git pre-commit hook`_ is installed during `Download and install`_.

If you want to run them manually, use the provided Makefile:

* run tests with ``make tests``
* build documentation with ``make documentation-build``
* build README with ``make README-build``
